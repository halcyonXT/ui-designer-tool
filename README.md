In the vast landscape of online communities, there exists an insufferable relic, an aged egoist, who, with every keystroke, reinforces the delusion that his mere existence holds unparalleled significance. 

This self-proclaimed guardian of a certaub community Discord server is a spectacle of arrogance and inefficacy. 

Instead of moderating with a semblance of competence, he resorts to sporadic interventions â€” handing out warnings like a miser distributing crumbs. 

His online presence mirrors his penchant for ghosting; disappearing for days without a trace.

A power-tripper in the truest sense, he clings to an archaic rulebook with unyielding fervor, blindly enforcing regulations even when they defy reason. 

Common courtesy is a foreign concept to him, as he navigates the server with a superiority complex, convinced of his lofty status above the mere mortals who dare to share his online domain.
